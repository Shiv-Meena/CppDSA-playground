**BRUTE FORCE**
The code has functional issues and inefficiencies. The logic for moving zeroes is flawed and redundant. A single pass approach with two pointers is much more efficient. The code also lacks clarity and would benefit from better variable names and a more structured approach.

Line 3: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops. Consider using a two-pointer approach for O(n) time complexity.
Line 4-9: The first loop attempts to move zeroes to the end, but it's inefficient. If nums[j] is 0, the inner loop shifts elements, but this can lead to unnecessary swaps and incorrect placement of zeroes.
Line 10-14: This second loop is redundant and appears to be an attempt to correct the issues from the first loop. It exhibits the same inefficiencies and potential for incorrect behavior.
Line 3: Rename 'n' to 'numsSize' for better readability.
Line 4-14: Replace the nested loop approach. Use two pointers: one to track the current position and another to track the next non-zero element.
Line 4-14: Consider refactoring the zero-moving logic into a separate, well-defined private function to improve modularity and readability.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
       int n=nums.size();
       for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        for(int j=i;j<n-1;j++){
            if(nums[j]==0){
                nums[j]=nums[j+1];
                nums[j+1]=0;
            }
        }
       } 
       for(int j=0;j<n-1;j++){
          if(nums[j]==0){
                nums[j]=nums[j+1];
                nums[j+1]=0;
            }
       }
    }
};
```

**OPTIMAL APPROACH**
TWO-POINTER

Time Complexity:O(n) because it iterates through the array at most twice, once to find the first zero and then again to swap non-zero elements.

Space Complexity:O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
       int n=nums.size();
       int j=-1;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(nums[i]==0){
            j=i;
            break;
        }
       }
       if(j==-1) return;
       for(int i=j+1;i<n;i++){
        if(nums[i]!=0){
            swap(nums[i],nums[j]);
            j++;
        }
       }
    }
};
